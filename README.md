# Socket-programming
 This code uses a stream socket to implement a Python TIME TCP client and test it with 2 servers from the time.nist.gov server . 
 The program reads time from 2 servers and displays: 
 - The IP address of each server.
 - Time of each server in a human readable format. 
 - Time difference between the two times retrieved.
